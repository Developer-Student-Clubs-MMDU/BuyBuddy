In today's fast-paced digital marketplace, customers are often overwhelmed by the challenges of finding the best products online. The process is hindered by time-consuming searches, information overload, inconsistent data, and a lack of centralized comparison options. These issues can lead to decision fatigue, making it difficult for customers to choose the right products, ultimately resulting in dissatisfaction and wasted time.

5. Return Policy Verification
   This feature verifies if products can be opened and inspected upon delivery, enabling prompt returns for unsatisfactory items and offering reassurance to online shoppers.
